<div> Visualization: Project One</div>
<div> Below please find a map of earthquakes taking place worldwide over the course of a day (in red) overlaid with storm events in the US during November 2014 (in blue). The map is designed to highlight the disparate geographies that produce each type of event, as well as the few interesting points of contiguity. </div>

<div> Visualization: Project Two</div>
<div> Below please find a map of Foursquare check-ins by rat sightings in the neighborhood of Bushwick-Ridgewood, Brooklyn. Foursquare check-ins are defined by a 500m radius from a location in this neighborhood, and are visualized using a chloropleth range that breaks total number of check-ins into three categories (0 minimum, 1043 maximum). (It is unclear the range of dates corresponding to these check-ins). Rat sightings are visualized as a heat map, and are pulled from 311 census data for such incidents in zip code 11237 between November 2014 and April 2015. The basemap highlights major streets to orient the viewer. </div>

<div> Visualization: Project Three</div>
<div> Below please find a heat map of NYC public school locations overlaid with total population per zip code. The source of these data is NYC Open Data Portal. Population is broken into three buckets (darker red meaning more population). Public school locations are visualized as a heat map to highlight the density of public schools rather than the specific locations of any individual school. The goal was to flag areas with high population and low public school density.</div>
